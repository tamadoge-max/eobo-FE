        "answer3": "eobo is set to unite community power and user-friendly decentralized finance (DeFi) tools into a single platform. The future of eobo will encompass features such as LP pairs, launchpad functionality and leaderboards, creating a comprehensive experience for users.",
        "question4": "Is eobo a safe token to invest in?",
        "answer4": "The eobo utility token is not positioned as an investment opportunity; rather, it serves as a token designed for entertainment purposes. It is crucial to engage in thorough research and exercise responsible trading practices, given that the value of the eobo utility token can be influenced by market dynamics. Cryptocurrencies may be unregulated in your jurisdiction and the value of cryptocurrencies may go down as well as up. Taxes may be applicable in your jurisdiction.",
        "question5": "Can I buy eobo in pre-sale?",
        "answer5": "Join our communities to learn more about how to get involved. eobo operates on a decentralized, community-powered model, with no specific individual or entity holding an excessive number of tokens. This approach is designed to promote fairness within the community, fostering an equitable ecosystem for all members.",
        "question6": "How big is the $EOBO supply, and how is it guarded?",
        "answer6": "Please read the docs to learn more! eobo has a supply of 1 billion (1.000.000.000) $EOBO tokens. A large part of the supply is locked into DeFi ecosystem mechanisms, the rest in secure multi-signature wallets. Our fundamental principle is to foster the flourishing of this community without any aggressive profit motives for entities or individuals. Let's witness the boundless potential of this initiative and strive for self-sustainability.",
        "question7": "When will Heartbeat, Gifts and other DeFi tools go live?",
        "answer7": "Our future products will be funded with the donation wallet that is connected to our staking program. Heartbeat integrates with various social networks and therefore needs time and funds to build, test and deliver. We have a plan for it and will start executing when $EOBO has sufficient market cap to eventually become self sustainable! That is the ultimate goal."
